'''Assignments Due Tonight and a Note About Discussions'''

~ Wyatt Taylor

Good afternoon! This is a friendly reminder that your discussion for Module 4 (Chapters 20 & 21) is due by tonight at midnight. There is no quiz for this module.

In regards to the discussion assignments, we actually slipped a bit as a class from Module 2, in which the class had an average grade of 41.31 or 83%, to Module 3, in which we had an average grade of 40.14 or 80%. I'd love to see everyone earning 50 points each week, so here are some tips that will hopefully help raise the class average:

1) Do your best to submit your initial posts (your answers to the questions) by midnight Wednesday of each week. This gives your classmates more time to read and respond to your work. Then take the rest of the week to complete the quiz (when applicable) and respond to your classmates.

2) Be sure to cite your work. I prefer in-text citations (Author / Page) as well as a full MLA-style citation at the bottom of your work. This is a good habit to get into, one that will serve you well throughout college. Review the citations booster or visit the Purdue OWL website on MLA citations as necessary.

3) Try to respond to three classmates each week. In addition, those responses should be well thought-out and articulated. What did the classmates get wrong or right? Did they leave anything out? Did they help you gain a better understanding of a topic? Use your responses to commend your classmates or help them get better. Please keep responses constructive.

I hope this helps.

Prof. Taylor
