====== Extra Credit ======

<blockquote>
Good morning! So I like to give a lot of opportunities for extra credit. I wanted to wait until we got through those crowded first few weeks to start, so here we go...

You can earn 10 points for every history museum, historic site, or event you attend during the course of the semester (up to 40 points total.) This can easily be the difference from one letter grade to the next, so please take advantage. To prove that you visited a site/museum/event, email me either a "selfie" or a picture of a brochure/pamphlet/business card signed by someone from the place you visited. 

I also offer 5 points for each episode of Crash Course US history you watch on YouTube. To earn the 5 points, please email me 5 facts you learned from watching the episode. For our current module, you can watch episode 25 (Growth, Cities and Immigration).

I will try to remind you about the Crash Course episodes for each module. Should I forget, please feel free to watch the appropriate episode for each module and email me your 5 facts.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Prof. Taylor
