'''Due Date:''' By Midnight Wednesday

<blockquote>
Preferably by midnight Wednesday (Sep 21), please respond to at least one of the following writing prompts. 

Your responses should contain at least 1 to 3 paragraphs per question, focusing on quality of response over quantity. 

Briefly substantiate your answers and opinions with material culled from the reading assignment. These are to be thorough and thoughtful responses, since they will guarantee that you are reading all of the work assigned, and gaining a deeper understanding of how these issues relate to the course overall. 

In these responses, you should practice your ability to explain your understanding of an historical issue and how it impacted the development of American history as a whole. 

You should also be able to support and defend your points with evidence and explanation from what you’ve read.

**Over the rest of the week (through Sunday, September 25)**, read your classmates’ Discussion Board postings and respond to at least TWO of your classmate’s postings. 
**You can explain why you agree or disagree with that student (in a respectful way), or share information relating to the student’s post. 
Students may also make comments and pose questions regarding other issues brought up in the forum.**

Discussions will be graded using the applicable rubric. 

While I will not be grading for spelling and grammar, a poorly written post will result in a lower grade. 

It’s important to demonstrate **college-level writing ability**, if for no other reason than submitting work your professor and classmates can understand.
