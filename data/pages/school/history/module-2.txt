<blockquote>
Good morning. Please remember that you will earn a higher score on your discussion if you submit your initial posts prior to midnight tonight. I added a file link in Module 2 to the Powerpoint presentation I use when lecturing on Chapter 17. Feel free to look through it if you think it might help with the module. I'm about to start grading your Module 1 discussions and will leave feedback designed to help you improve your score going forward.

Good luck!

Prof. Taylor
