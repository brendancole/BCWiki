<p>
Which file types you can upload via the media manager popup or the fullscreen media manager is configured through the <i>conf/mime.conf</i> file. Additional mimetypes should be added in <i>mime.local.conf</i>. The file expects an extension (without the dot) and a mime type. Prefixing the mime type with an exclamation mark (!) will force the browser to present a download dialog, even if a browser plugin for the file in question exists.

<div class="level3">
<pre class="code"># this would play in the browser (if supported):
wav         audio/wav

# this would be downloaded
wav         !audio/wav</pre>

<p>
File type icons can be added by placing an image file (PNG or GIF) named after the file extension into <i>lib/images/fileicons/</i>.
</p>

<p>
**Note:** because the stylesheet used for assigning the fileicons gets cached you need to force a rebuild by touching one of the config files.
